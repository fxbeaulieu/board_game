You need to clear the `sidebar` surface at the beginning of each frame, otherwise the old contents will still be visible. You can do this by filling it with a color, for example, black or white.

Add this line at the start of your main loop:

```python
sidebar.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Fills the sidebar with black color
```

Also, currently you're blitting your sidebar and then drawing on it. You should draw on your sidebar first, then blit it onto the main screen. So, this:

```python
screen.blit(sidebar, (SCREEN_WIDTH - SIDEBAR_WIDTH, 0))
player_stats = sidebar_title_font.render("Joueurs", True, (255, 255, 255))
sidebar.blit(player_stats, (20, 10))
sidebar.blit(dice_1, (20, SCREEN_HEIGHT - 100))
```

Should become:

```python
player_stats = sidebar_title_font.render("Joueurs", True, (255, 255, 255))
sidebar.blit(player_stats, (20, 10))
sidebar.blit(dice_1, (20, SCREEN_HEIGHT - 100))
screen.blit(sidebar, (SCREEN_WIDTH - SIDEBAR_WIDTH, 0))
```

And finally, when you're drawing the dice onto the sidebar, you're using `SCREEN_HEIGHT` to calculate the y-coordinate. But `SCREEN_HEIGHT` is the height of the main screen, not the sidebar. If you want to position the dice near the bottom of the sidebar, you should use `SIDEBAR_WIDTH` instead:

```python
sidebar.blit(dice_1, (20, SIDEBAR_WIDTH - 100))
```
